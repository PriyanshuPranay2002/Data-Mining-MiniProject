INTRODUCTION: -

This project is an examination of a subset of a dataset containing information on known terrorist occurrences in INDIA over the previous 50 years. All of these instances fit the criteria for being classified as terrorist acts.
The reason this topic was chosen for the project is that it is easier to apply data mining efforts and is also interesting enough to extract some conclusions, as opposed to other topics that included concepts that were difficult to understand and thus would have made it too difficult to develop meaningful conclusions with our analysis results.

Furthermore, the fact that data is made up of incidents that occur in a given location allows for the creation of maps that represent it with different aims in mind, providing an interesting alternative to graphs for displaying the data in different ways.

DATASET and DATA SELECTION: -

The Global Terrorism Database dataset was uploaded by the START (Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism) Consortium. The collection is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd.

On September 20, 2022, the dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. The sole requirement was that a Kaggle account is created, and the option to sign up through Google was picked. Despite having information on incidences on a global scale, the scope was limited to INDIA due to the volume of data. Because there were many categorical attributes expressed twice: once with a numerical code and again with the actual word of the category, the repeated columns that gave the same information were cleansed. The textual ones were maintained since the numerical ones indicated the same thing but required looking at an external table to understand.
